Selective chemical conversion or separation in zeolites is based on the sizes and shapes of sorbate molecules relative to the pores and channels of the sorbent host. However, the crystallographic pore sizes are substantially smaller than those inferred from catalytic transformation and molecular sieving capabilities, reflecting flexible variation in zeolite opening pores. Here, employing the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite as imaging windows and benzene as a probe molecule in *in situ* electron microscopy, we observed sub-cell flexibility in a rigid zeolite framework: the opening pores were stretched along the longest direction of confined benzene molecules with a maximum aspect change of 15%, while the Pnma spacegroup symmetry of the MFI framework makes adjacent channels’ deformation compensate for each other and maintained the stability and rigidity of the overall unit cell within 0.5% deformation. The sub-cell flexibility originates mainly from the topologic soft Si-O-Si hinges between rigid tetrahedral SiO4, with the inner angle varying from 135° to 153°, confirmed by *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This work has settled the long-standing controversy about the mechanism of molecular diffusion breaking through the pore size limit and revealed the origin of sub-cell topologic flexibility in rigid zeolites.
