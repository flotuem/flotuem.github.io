Hi, I'm Hao Xiong, a PhD candidate in Chemical Eingineering, supervised by Prof. Fei Wei, at Tsinghua University(THU,清华大学),China. My research interests are mainly focused on

​	 (1)In-situ heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts;

​	(2)Atomic-scale imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules using scanning transmission electron microscopy

​	(3)Electron ptychography——super-resolution coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials.
