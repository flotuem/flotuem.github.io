This is Hao Xiong's personal homepage.

## Introduction 

My name is Hao Xiong, and I am a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof. Fei Wei](https://www.chemeng.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1094/2395.htm)  at Tsinghua University(THU,清华大学) , starting from 2019. I obtained my undergraduate certificate in chemical engineering, and more recently embarked in studying advanced electron microscopy.  Currently, I am working at the spatial and temporal non-periodic phenomenon in sub-nanoscale heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, I am a huge fan of badminton and CSGO, which we can talk about over night except for the above academic thing.



## Research interest:

- Heterogeneous catalysis on zeolite catalysts

- In-situ  imaging of zeolites and absorbed small molecules at atomic scale

- Electron ptychography: super-resolution scanning coherent diffractive imaging of porous materials
